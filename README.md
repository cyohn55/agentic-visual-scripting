- **Command Palette**: Quick access to all features with Ctrl/Cmd+K
- **Context Menus**: Right-click to create and manage objects
- **Basic Objects**: Sticky notes, text files, and shapes

### Planned Features
- **Phase 2**: Smart objects (Code editor, AI models), semantic connections
- **Phase 3**: Execution engine, AI agents, templating system
- **Phase 4**: Real-time collaboration, versioning, marketplace

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Usage
