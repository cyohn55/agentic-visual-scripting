# Agentic Visual Scripting - Design Requirements

## Overview
A React/TypeScript-based visual workflow editor that allows users to create, edit, and execute visual scripts through a node-based interface.

## Core Features
- **Visual Node Editor**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating workflows
- **Multiple Node Types**: Control flow, sticky notes, text files, shapes
- **Execution Engine**: Real-time workflow execution with variable management
- **Real-time Visualization**: Live execution path highlighting
- **Export/Import**: Save and load workflow definitions

## UI/UX Requirements
- **Modern Interface**: Clean, intuitive design with good visual hierarchy
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes
- **Theme Support**: Light/dark mode capabilities
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Performance**: Smooth interactions even with complex workflows

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Custom stores with reactive patterns
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for consistent design system
- **Node System**: ReactFlow-based with custom node types
- **Execution**: Custom execution engine with step-by-step processing

## Node Types
1. **Control Flow Nodes**: Start, end, decision, process
2. **Data Nodes**: Variable assignment, data manipulation
3. **UI Nodes**: Sticky notes, shape annotations
4. **File Nodes**: Text file content and operations

## User Interaction Patterns
- **Canvas Navigation**: Pan, zoom, select, multi-select
- **Node Creation**: Palette-based creation with contextual options
- **Property Editing**: Side panel for node configuration
- **Execution Control**: Play, pause, stop, step-through controls
